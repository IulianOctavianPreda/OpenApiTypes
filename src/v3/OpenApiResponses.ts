/** Any HTTP status code can be used as the property name, but only one property per code, to describe the expected response for that HTTP status code. A Reference Object can link to a response that is defined in the OpenAPI Object's components/responses section. This field MUST be enclosed in quotation marks (for example, "200") for compatibility between JSON and YAML. To define a range of response codes, this field MAY contain the uppercase wildcard character X. For example, 2XX represents all response codes between [200-299]. Only the following range definitions are allowed: 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, and 5XX. If a response is defined using an explicit code, the explicit code definition takes precedence over the range definition for that code. */
